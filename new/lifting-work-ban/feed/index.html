		<description><![CDATA[I have come to know that i am imposed one year ban. why? I was terminated from previous employer because of unsuccessful probation period. they gave me termination letter and one month notice period for another job. I got another company&#039;s job offer and also i got NOC from previous sponsor. after applying new visa, my application has been cancelled because of the one year ban. Can it be lifted?]]></description>
