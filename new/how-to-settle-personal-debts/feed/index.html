		<description><![CDATA[During July 2015, i have left UAE after cancelling my visa and came to Oman. Currently i am in Oman. Due to financial issues, i can&#039;t able to clear the credit cards of some banks (Mashreq bank &#038; Dunia). Since, the banks aware that i am not in UAE, they are now calling my home country and started harassing them for the payments. They also started calling me to my Oman number. I am trying to negotiate for settlement, but they are asking for double the credit card limit amount. Please advise me on this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This for the information that i have worked for a company in UAE for 3 yrs from 2004-2007.
I have some unpaid credit card payments to be done for AED 13000. Here in india I dont have a good job so couldnt pay back but now I have got an opportunity in Saudi Arabia and like to know if my work visa will be rejected as I am a defaulter in Dubai (UAE). As now my salary will be better I will be in a position to repay the debt.

How can I resolve the issue. I dont know which bank it is as I got a call from a recovery agent here in India and they r saying u r defaulter in 2 credit cards and it amount to AED 13000. Now if I get this saudi job I intend to clear this debt but how can I know which banks I am defaulter in.

Please let me know as how it can be resolved and what with it cost me, I mean your professional charges.

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[I returned from Dubai, UAE in 2007 due to some personal reasons and had a loan and credit card from Mashreq Bank Dubai. Total balance acknowledged by the bank as of today is AED 23,000 (Twenty Three Thousand).
I am ready to pay/settle the loan at a negotiated amount but I am not sure how will I ensure that my name has been cleared in the police record and case of bounced security check has been dropped. If I travel to dubai, they might detain me at the airport so I want to be sure that my name has been cleared and that I will have no problem travelling to Dubai, UAE.
Kindly advise me as to how to proceed. Also tell me your professional fee for making sure that my name is cleared in police and all cases dropped.

Regards
ZM]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi I have a friend who wants to settle his dues in Dubai but doesn’t know how much is outstanding and /or with who all. He remembers the names of few Banks but not sure how much he owes them. Recently he had applied for a Police Clearance from UAE police but that got refused. He thinks it maybe because of a few outstanding he had during his stay there before recession.

Can you help him close the loans (wherever applicable) and get a PC? 

Regards,

VD]]></description>
